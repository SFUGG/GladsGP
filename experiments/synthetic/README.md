# Synthetic experiment

GP emulation of GlaDS outputs for a synthetic model domain.

## Experiment configuration

The experiment configuration is specified in `train_config.py` and `test_config.py` files. These configuration files specify options for the GlaDS simulations and GP analysis.

## Running GlaDS ensembles

Input files for the GlaDS simulations can be generated by running `make` (see the `Makefile`). The default target makes all required inputs from data and scripts in the `issm/data/` directory and using options in the configuration files, and designs the set of model inputs in `expdesign/`. GlaDS simulations are exectued from `issm/train` and `issm/test`, using the Digital Research Alliance MetaFarm package to manage parallelizing batches of jobs.

## Fitting GP emulators

Emulator fitting is done from `analysis/`. `fit_all_models.py` fits models for various m (number of simulations) and p (number of principal components) values (passed as command-line arguments).

## Analysis and plotting scripts

The remaining scripts in `analysis` do various plotting and analysis tasks. Some of these are computationally intensive enough that they have corresponding `submit_*.sh` scripts to run on HPC resources. In particular, `assess_all_models.py` computes RMSE, MAPE and prediction uncertainty for models with various m and p values.
